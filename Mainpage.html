<h2>Computer programming language, any of the various languages for a digital computer to communicate a series of comprehensive instructions.
 Such instructions can be executed directly when expressed in a corresponding assembly language in the computer-specific numerical form known as
 machine language, after a simple substitution process;.</h2>
<h2>Perhaps after any "higher-level" translation. While there are many computer languages, 
relatively few are widely used. Machine and assembly languages are "low-level," requiring a programmer to explicitly manage all 
of the idiosyncratic data storage and operation features of a computer. On the other hand, high-level languages shield a programmer from 
worrying about such considerations, and provide a notation that is easier for programmers to write and read.</h2>
